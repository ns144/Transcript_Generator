SPEAKER 1 0:00:00
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be here. Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be here. I tell you, not much Wonderunchy, but me too in S.S. I also think that with the result of this long series of Keynesian astrocy conditions, like being % Maduro and some of us might hateATE follow bounds, 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:45
even like beingumbles as well. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:48
But we than dear friends ofUSE unchartedApparts, speaking about it. Very closely, I didn't guarantee you. That's how the Hijnokan is in focus. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:59
Oh yes, for sure. Because when we traffled, and when I traffled to Central Asia, and I found out that there are deaf Christians, and I was not aware of them. 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:12
And as Open Door Steam in Central Asia, we were not aware that there even are deaf people, and who are they? 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:20
And what is their situation? 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:22
So we had contact with them and then found out that deaf people are the most neglected minority in society. They don't have jobs, they don't receive payment at all. 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:34
Sometimes they have health problems. They are a shame in the culture. 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:39
And then we found out that there are deaf Christians, 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:43
people who came to faith, and they asked us, as Open Door's, can you help us? 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:49
But the problem was that we received for that year money from Open Door's International, an amount, say you can spend this amount for your plans and the work, 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:59
and you have to stick to that. But we found out we really need to help these deaf believers. 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:06
So we asked again, Open Door's International, 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:09
this is happening. We see that God is directing us this way to help these neglected deaf believers. And Open Door's International said yes. 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:20
So we had to change our plans, 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:22
and we asked the deaf believers, who are you and what do you need? 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:26
And that's the strength of Open Door's that we are there, 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:29
where people are persecuted. 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:31
Just like Brother Andrew, the founder of Open Door's, 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:35
he traveled to find his brothers and sisters. 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:38
And so I also found myself traveling, 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:41
finding new believers, deaf Christians. 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:45
I think that's why we are here. Well again, when you are there you will always be 
SPEAKER 2 0:03:05
connected with us. Well that prayer is the key. 
SPEAKER 1 0:03:10
I think that prayer is the key. Because when we started to pray for deaf Christians and also to open doors really literally we 
SPEAKER 2 0:03:21
saw that things were changing in a deed. 
SPEAKER 1 0:03:24
And it happened also with some miracles that deaf believers are in an area where we really 
SPEAKER 2 0:03:30
protected well. Some of them healed. So we really saw that God with sign and wonders was entering our prayers. 
SPEAKER 1 0:03:40
So we started to ask prayer for these deaf believers. And at the same time we started to help them. 
SPEAKER 2 0:03:46
What can we do for you? 
SPEAKER 1 0:03:49
We were interested in the prayer of those who were not in the same place. We were interested in the healing of our deaf people. We were interested in the healing of our deaf people. Oh and, our children are sorry to God if you are not on a move. 
SPEAKER 2 0:04:09
Why won? 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:10
We are working well there. If you visit me at Melbourne they can dont speak well. 
SPEAKER 2 0:04:17
It allowed you to Bible in loudly our love and attention. 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:34
We found out that some people were so depressed and neglected. Imagine that we are in a small village together. 
SPEAKER 2 0:04:41
Only a few people lived there. 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:44
Also a little bit folk Islam and then a deaf person who doesnt have any rights or things 
SPEAKER 2 0:04:51
to say or an income and that person received Christ in her heart. 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:57
And she was already depressed of the situation and then the villagers want to kick her out of the village and say we will not give you any fresh water anymore. So it really happened that one woman said what is the reason for me to be here on earth. And she really wanted to commit suicide. 
SPEAKER 2 0:05:18
She said I dont see any hope again. 
SPEAKER 1 0:05:20
Nobody wants me. 
SPEAKER 2 0:05:23
And then she had a can with petrol and she took it and she wanted to throw it over her. And before she just was here with the can somebody knocked on the door. It was an evangelist paid by open doors who really thought I today must go to that village. I must see if there are people. And then at the moment when he knocked on the door she knew I am watched. 
SPEAKER 1 0:05:54
I am seen. There is somebody. She opened the door and then she says of course hospitality come in. 
SPEAKER 2 0:06:01
Do you like to have food? She didnt have any food. Then she found out this person is a good person. And then they prayed together and our evangelist said we will not let you alone. 
SPEAKER 1 0:06:15
We will take care of you and make sure that you will feel part of the community. So she really had to move. It was not good for her to stay. We brought her to another region for other deaf believers and that she felt accepted. 
SPEAKER 2 0:06:30
That she felt seen. And now she received even a micro credit and she has her own mail shop at the moment. 
SPEAKER 1 0:06:39
Her moment, her life changed really at the moment then when open doors knocked on the 
SPEAKER 2 0:06:44
door. Its there somebody. It was a defining moment in her life. 
SPEAKER 1 0:06:49
Our 30 men shafted them. We are in the same place. We are in the same place. We are in the same place. We are in the same place. We are in the same place. 
SPEAKER 2 0:07:16
We are in the same place. First prayer is really important. 
SPEAKER 1 0:07:20
What many Christians experience and also the deaf Christians, if we tell, we will share 
SPEAKER 2 0:07:26
your story. 
SPEAKER 1 0:07:27
Like today, I share this story of this woman and we will pray for you. 
SPEAKER 2 0:07:32
That means so much for them. 
SPEAKER 1 0:07:34
That there is somebody out there in the world wide community. 
SPEAKER 2 0:07:38
People are praying. They are seen. 
SPEAKER 1 0:07:42
At the same time, we say prayer and also just like we learn from brother Andrew, the founder of open doors, we act. We always say, what can we do? We provided small Bible courses for them. 
SPEAKER 2 0:07:56
Sign language. 
SPEAKER 1 0:07:57
We say, you need to have better sign language and provided also for an income. We train them and we make cartoons with them. You have to show the gospel. At a certain moment when I traveled with these deaf Christians, they showed me how they shared 
SPEAKER 2 0:08:16
the gospel in a play together. 
SPEAKER 1 0:08:18
They make a very simple play together and then sharing and explaining that Christ died for 
SPEAKER 2 0:08:26
us. 
SPEAKER 1 0:08:27
And when I was in a play together, I thought, I'd be like, what do you think? I'm a pastor. 
SPEAKER 2 0:08:35
Yes. 
SPEAKER 1 0:08:36
This is so powerful of this movement, they don't want to have it for themselves. 
SPEAKER 2 0:08:41
Everybody must receive Christ and especially the deaf. So, I was aware of such a play. 
SPEAKER 1 0:08:48
And for me, I really sense this is so pure, so simple. It comes so close to the real belief in Jesus Christ. It is totally not by mind. 
SPEAKER 2 0:09:00
It's completely about the heart. And I was really moved and I thought, wow, this is close to heaven. And what I experienced. Amazing. 
SPEAKER 1 0:09:10
This is what I'm saying. It's not about the word, it's about the word, it's about the word, it's about the word. I'm not a human, but I'm a human. 
SPEAKER 2 0:09:24
Yes. Yes. Yes. 
SPEAKER 1 0:09:27
Well, what really helped also that I found out that deaf believers, they really need also their own income for. 
SPEAKER 2 0:09:33
And it's about shame and honor. 
SPEAKER 1 0:09:37
That was very important. And when I met them, they really want to talk with me. 
SPEAKER 2 0:09:42
And I couldn't. 
SPEAKER 1 0:09:44
And we found out we also made sure that we can communicate. So what we did is open doors in Central Asia and one of the countries, we opened a 
SPEAKER 2 0:09:52
deaf center. 
SPEAKER 1 0:09:54
And we said we want to communicate with each other and make sure that deaf Christians 
SPEAKER 2 0:09:58
are, need everything what they want. 
SPEAKER 1 0:10:02
And now we have this deaf center. It's opened last year and we started with the youth, the young people also from children 
SPEAKER 2 0:10:09
who has deaf parents. And how is it? 
SPEAKER 1 0:10:12
And we started with sign language, cartoon, whatever, but also to communicate with each 
SPEAKER 2 0:10:17
other. 
SPEAKER 1 0:10:18
So how can I have a conversation with a deaf Christian that they feel really part of God's 
SPEAKER 2 0:10:25
community? So this deaf center is now beautiful place. 
SPEAKER 1 0:10:30
And we have seen pictures and we saw that many people are coming from other regions, 
SPEAKER 2 0:10:36
from other countries. 
SPEAKER 1 0:10:37
They come in for a week. 
SPEAKER 2 0:10:39
It's kind of retreat. And they receive every training what they need. 
SPEAKER 1 0:10:44
Is it maybe an income generating project or a vocational training? 
SPEAKER 2 0:10:49
We make sure after that period you are helped. And that you are connected to the worldwide community. And this is the strength of open doors. That we are really there, just like Brother Andrew, and that we see what God is doing. 
SPEAKER 1 0:11:09
And it was not us, our idea to work with deaf people. 
SPEAKER 2 0:11:12
They came to us. 
SPEAKER 1 0:11:13
We were in the reaction when the people who were in the English shift, they came to us. And we were in the English shift. And they mentioned that it was a very good reaction. 
SPEAKER 2 0:11:30
Oh, they were so surprised. It was for a new world that opened up. 
SPEAKER 1 0:11:34
We were not aware of that this could happen. That our people are taking care of for us. That even our Christians worldwide, they had no idea. They only know their own village. And also that there is a special deaf youth center where they can come and that they receive 
SPEAKER 2 0:11:53
every help they need. It's amazing. 
SPEAKER 1 0:11:56
So this helped them also in their really their longing to share the gospel. 
SPEAKER 2 0:12:02
That's really central Asia. Once you receive Christ, you want to share it with your neighbor. 
SPEAKER 1 0:12:09
And now we support a lot of evangelists. 
SPEAKER 2 0:12:12
And they asked us now for motorcycles because they drive very long distance and remote areas. And well, they need a motorcycle or a car, but sometimes it's too expensive. But we provided already some motorcycles. And I saw pictures that they drive for hours and to one deaf Christian. Only that Christian is visited. And I think that is the sense of God's love. God really saw that person, that woman in that village. And also this evangelist on his motorcycle from time to time, he fissed people. 
SPEAKER 1 0:12:52
Because sometimes indeed they are still neglected in society. 
SPEAKER 2 0:12:56
They are watched. They don't sometimes have food enough. We make sure that they don't feel alone and that we can help them. 
SPEAKER 1 0:13:07
So this is still a growing movement. 
SPEAKER 2 0:13:09
And it surprised us a lot. 
SPEAKER 1 0:13:11
And that's what we learned also. 
SPEAKER 2 0:13:13
Hey, this is what God is doing. And with signs, with miracles like this woman that her life was saved. It was amazing. 
SPEAKER 1 0:13:25
Do you understand the reactions that God has to do with the human life? 
SPEAKER 2 0:13:34
No. 
SPEAKER 1 0:13:36
The difficult thing is that the government and also local governments, it's a shame. They don't exist for them. 
SPEAKER 2 0:13:43
They don't want to do anything for them. 
SPEAKER 1 0:13:47
And that's really difficult because we want to also say, how can we make their lives better 
SPEAKER 2 0:13:52
that they feel part of society? 
SPEAKER 1 0:13:55
We can do our part, but we can't change the government or local governments. And what we sensed is that the deaf people must share the love of God. And I think love makes a difference. 
SPEAKER 2 0:14:08
And when I saw the simple and pure love of deaf Christians, I was really touched. 
SPEAKER 1 0:14:15
And I think this can make a difference for to be a difference in society. 
SPEAKER 2 0:14:20
Yes, they are persecuted. Yes, they are neglected. 
SPEAKER 1 0:14:24
But they forgive and they say, how can I help you? Can I do something for you? 
SPEAKER 2 0:14:30
And still find relationship. And with God's love, people are changing. Yes. Yes. 
SPEAKER 1 0:14:37
Yes. I think that the truth is that the truth is not the truth. When the Bible says, the truth is the truth. It's the effect of the truth. That's what it is like to have the truth. 
SPEAKER 2 0:14:55
That's what it is. Well, that a lot of things are not important in life. And from deaf Christians, I learned to be so pure and simple. 
SPEAKER 1 0:15:04
Keep it simple. Keep it pure. 
SPEAKER 2 0:15:06
Close to my heart. 
SPEAKER 1 0:15:08
And don't make it to theology or whatever. 
SPEAKER 2 0:15:12
That's really the faith of Jesus. It's so simple. And at the same time, so effective. 
SPEAKER 1 0:15:19
So I really stopped with a lot of things in my mind and also in my behavior to say, what is today really important? 
SPEAKER 2 0:15:28
Yeah. And that is love. 
SPEAKER 1 0:15:30
That we share God's love. 
SPEAKER 2 0:15:32
And I learned this from the deaf Christians. 
SPEAKER 1 0:15:35
And sometimes I'm making my faith too complicated. 
SPEAKER 2 0:15:39
Or I doubt too much. Or I doubt up myself or about church. And then I go back, look at these deaf Christians. Only love. They love each other. And that love really changed lives. 
SPEAKER 1 0:15:52
Also my life. And the fun is that I live in Christ. One of the things I learned from the Bible is that I've been speaking in Christ. 
SPEAKER 2 0:16:05
And I've been speaking in Christ. 
SPEAKER 1 0:16:07
I've been speaking in Christ. And I've been speaking in Christ. And to my 84th conversation, the medical experience is veryag so I can't figure out this side or somebody I'm most grateful of in this profession, and I'm not sure if I'm feeling the same of healing, and sometimes even trauma counseling. 
SPEAKER 2 0:16:45
So now we work also with coaches and other people to say, we need to see you from time to time, because you accept that Christ, but your heart is not healed yet. 
SPEAKER 1 0:16:57
And that's the next step. And we provide now and say, okay, how can we help them in this burden, in this need? 
SPEAKER 2 0:17:05
And we have several coaches, and they are trained on how to work with deaf people to make sure that they can heal, because they are wounded. Yes. That's the reality. 
SPEAKER 1 0:17:16
I'm very grateful that you are not a good person, but you are a good person. You are a good person. 
SPEAKER 2 0:17:24
You are a good person. 
SPEAKER 1 0:17:26
You are a good person. 
SPEAKER 2 0:17:28
Yes. Dear Lord, we are thankful for what you do today. 
SPEAKER 1 0:17:34
And when we hear from our deaf Christians in Central Asia, that it was your idea to reach them with your love, 
SPEAKER 2 0:17:42
and I praise you for that. 
SPEAKER 1 0:17:44
Thank you for this pure and simple community that they are a great example of how I can live my faith, 
SPEAKER 2 0:17:51
pure and simple with love. 
SPEAKER 1 0:17:54
And thank you that you really changed lives, even from the woman that you want to commit suicide, and that you helped her, that it was you who was knocking on the door. 
SPEAKER 2 0:18:05
And thank you that you helped us as open doors to help these people in prayer, in support, in everything what they need. 
SPEAKER 1 0:18:14
We praise you that we can so see how you built your kingdom. 
SPEAKER 2 0:18:19
And thank you for the hope that you give us when we look at these deaf Christians. Yes, life can be very difficult, but we can't lose hope. We need hope. And thank you for deaf Christians who are the hope for us also today. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen. Amen.
